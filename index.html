		<h2 id="impact"> <em> Our impact so far... </em> </h2>

		<p>Our past events
			To kick officially, we organized our first online webinar. Over 32 students were present (not bad for a start right?)
			This has helped to further the spread of Blockchain eduaction.

			It might interest you to know that we have an online community where we seek to train a lot of people(students). 
			With this, we are reaching out to more people; outside the UNN (University Of Nigeria) community.
